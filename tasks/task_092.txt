# Task ID: 92
# Title: Test Add-Task with Direct Anthropic Model Integration After Billing Update
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 83, 85, 88
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement and test the add-task command's direct integration with Anthropic models following the recent billing structure and token limit updates.
# Details:
This task involves verifying and ensuring the add-task command works correctly with the updated Anthropic API integration after billing changes:

1. Review the current implementation of add-task and its interaction with Anthropic models
2. Verify that the updated token limit configurations (maxInputTokens and maxOutputTokens) are properly applied when using add-task
3. Implement test cases that exercise the add-task command with various input sizes to ensure proper token management
4. Test the add-task command with the following scenarios:
   - Creating a simple task with minimal description
   - Creating a complex task with detailed requirements
   - Creating a task with the --research flag enabled
   - Creating a task with dependencies specified
5. Monitor and log token usage during these operations to ensure compliance with new billing structure
6. Update any hardcoded token limits or model references in the add-task implementation
7. Ensure proper error handling for cases where token limits are exceeded
8. Verify that the correct model version is being used (claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet, etc.)
9. Check that the system correctly calculates and displays token usage information to users
10. Document any changes made to the add-task command's interaction with Anthropic models

The implementation should prioritize efficiency in token usage while maintaining the quality of generated task content. Any issues discovered during testing should be documented and addressed.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create mock responses for Anthropic API calls to test different scenarios
   - Verify token counting logic works correctly with different input sizes
   - Test error handling when token limits are exceeded

2. Integration Testing:
   - Execute the add-task command with various inputs and verify correct API calls
   - Confirm that the correct model parameters are being passed to the Anthropic API
   - Verify that maxInputTokens and maxOutputTokens are respected in API calls

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Run the add-task command with the following test cases:
     a. `taskmaster add-task "Simple test task"` - verify basic functionality
     b. `taskmaster add-task "Complex task with many details" --details "Long detailed description..."` - test with larger inputs
     c. `taskmaster add-task "Research task" --research` - test research flag integration
     d. `taskmaster add-task "Dependent task" --dependencies 5,83,88` - test with dependencies

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response times for add-task operations with different input sizes
   - Compare token usage metrics before and after implementation

5. Validation:
   - Examine the tasks.json file to ensure created tasks have correct structure
   - Verify that token usage information is correctly logged
   - Check that appropriate error messages are displayed when limits are exceeded

6. Documentation Testing:
   - Verify that help text for add-task command reflects current functionality
   - Ensure any changes to token handling are documented in user guides
