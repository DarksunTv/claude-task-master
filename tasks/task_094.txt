# Task ID: 94
# Title: Implement Narrative Generation Module for Interactive Storytelling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 85, 92
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a narrative generation module that can create long-form stories with configurable themes, characters, and plot elements, starting with fantasy themes like dragons.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive narrative generation module that leverages AI models to create engaging long-form stories:

1. Create a new module structure in `scripts/modules/narrative-generator/`:
   - `index.js` - Main export file
   - `story-generator.js` - Core generation logic
   - `theme-templates.js` - Pre-defined story themes and elements
   - `character-builder.js` - Character development utilities
   - `plot-structure.js` - Story arc and plot point management

2. Implement the core story generation functionality:
   - Design a flexible schema for story parameters (theme, length, complexity, characters)
   - Create functions to generate story outlines based on user parameters
   - Implement progressive story generation that can produce content in chunks
   - Add support for fantasy themes with special focus on dragon-related narratives

3. Integrate with existing AI services:
   - Utilize the unified AI service interface from Task 85
   - Configure appropriate token limits for long-form content generation
   - Implement context management for maintaining narrative consistency
   - Add fallback mechanisms if story generation exceeds token limits

4. Create a user-friendly API for the narrative module:
   - Design function signatures that accept story parameters
   - Implement progress callbacks for long-running generations
   - Add support for saving/loading partial stories
   - Create helper functions for common story types (adventure, mystery, etc.)

5. Optimize for performance and quality:
   - Implement caching for common story elements
   - Add techniques to ensure narrative coherence across long texts
   - Create evaluation metrics for story quality
   - Implement content filtering for appropriate narratives

6. Add CLI command integration:
   - Create a new `generate-story` command
   - Support parameters for theme, length, characters, and output format
   - Implement interactive mode for collaborative storytelling
   - Add export options (text, markdown, HTML)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each core function in the narrative generation module
   - Test story parameter validation and error handling
   - Verify character and plot structure generation functions
   - Test theme template loading and customization

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with AI services using mock responses
   - Verify token limit handling and chunking for long stories
   - Test the complete story generation pipeline with various parameters
   - Validate proper integration with the CLI interface

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure generation time for stories of different lengths
   - Test memory usage during long story generation
   - Benchmark performance with different AI models
   - Verify caching mechanisms are working correctly

4. Quality Assurance:
   - Manually review generated stories for coherence and engagement
   - Create a test suite with diverse story prompts (e.g., "Tell me a very long story about a dragon")
   - Verify narrative consistency across long-form content
   - Test with edge cases like extremely long stories or unusual themes

5. User Experience Testing:
   - Conduct user testing sessions with the CLI interface
   - Gather feedback on story quality and generation options
   - Test interactive storytelling features
   - Verify export functionality produces well-formatted output

6. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure narrative generation doesn't interfere with other system components
   - Verify compatibility with existing task management features
   - Test with both development and production configurations
