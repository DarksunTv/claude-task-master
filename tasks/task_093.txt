# Task ID: 93
# Title: Test Add-Task with Anthropic Sonnet 4 as Research Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 54, 92
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement and test the add-task command's integration with Anthropic Sonnet 4 model specifically for the research functionality, ensuring optimal performance with the latest model version.
# Details:
This task involves updating and testing the add-task command to specifically utilize Anthropic's Sonnet 4 model for research functionality:

1. Review the current implementation of the research flag in the add-task command (from Task 54)
2. Update the AI service configuration to support Sonnet 4 as an option for the research model:
   - Modify ai-services.js or ai-services-unified.js to include Sonnet 4 model parameters
   - Update model selection logic to properly handle Sonnet 4 for research operations
   - Ensure proper token limits and configuration settings for Sonnet 4

3. Implement model-specific prompt engineering optimizations for Sonnet 4:
   - Adjust research prompts to leverage Sonnet 4's capabilities
   - Optimize context window usage for research queries
   - Implement proper error handling for Sonnet 4-specific responses

4. Add configuration options to specify Sonnet 4 as the default research model:
   - Update config-manager.js to include a researchModel setting
   - Implement command-line flag to override the default (--model=sonnet4)
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing configurations

5. Implement performance monitoring for research operations:
   - Track token usage specifically for research operations
   - Measure response times and quality metrics
   - Compare results with previous model versions

6. Update documentation to reflect the new model option:
   - Update help text for the add-task command
   - Document configuration options for research models
   - Provide usage examples specific to Sonnet 4 research

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the updated AI service configuration with Sonnet 4
   - Test model selection logic with various configuration settings
   - Verify proper error handling for Sonnet 4-specific API responses

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the add-task command with the --research flag using Sonnet 4
   - Verify that research results are properly incorporated into task creation
   - Test with various research topics of different complexity levels
   - Ensure the command works with both default settings and explicit model selection

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare token usage between different models for similar research queries
   - Evaluate response quality and relevance for technical topics
   - Test with large context research scenarios to verify context window utilization

4. Configuration Testing:
   - Verify that model selection works through both command-line flags and configuration files
   - Test backward compatibility with existing configurations
   - Ensure proper fallback behavior if Sonnet 4 is unavailable

5. Manual Testing Scenarios:
   - Create a new task with research on "GraphQL optimization techniques"
   - Create a task researching "Modern CI/CD pipelines"
   - Research a complex technical topic like "Distributed systems consensus algorithms"
   - Compare research quality with previous model versions on the same topics

6. Documentation Verification:
   - Verify that help text and documentation accurately reflect the new functionality
   - Ensure examples in documentation work as described
